            <h2>Input instructions</h2>
            <p>
                You have to consider the nature of your raw chlorine before using this app. Is it a solid compound,
                liquid or gaseous? What is the percentage purity of the chlorine compound you are using for your 
                water treatment? What is the volume of the raw water which you are trying to chlorinate? These 
                information will enable you to provide proper input. Where your water has low contaminant, your chlorine 
                demand might be very low, hence, there is no much challenge in the dozing process. However, where your
                water source is highly loaded, consider chlorine demand before you can know the required dose.

            <h2>My misson</h2>
            <p>
                My misson I have worked in the food and water industry. One of the thing that bothered me was 
                that we had to do calculations here and there each time we wanted to treat water or carryout 
                quality analysis, at least in most cases. There are many tools out there to make these calculations 
                easier, only that some of them are not dependable. Also, many of such tools focus on gallon (gal), 
                cubic meter (m3), Ounce (oz), instead of litre (L), kilogram (kg) and mg/L units popular in 
                countries like Nigeria. This means that one would have to go through a lot of unnecessary 
                conversional calculations before arriving at an answer. Besides, those tools also focus on large 
                volumes of water like spa. Therefore, it has always been on my mind to bring this solution: a tool 
                that calculates, simplifies, and gives answer in the language people in my locality can understand. 
                It has to be user-friendly and simple design. That is how Aquachloro Calculator came to be.
