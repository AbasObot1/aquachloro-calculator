            <p>
                Aquachloro Calculator is a water treatment application created for the water industry by Abas Obot. 
                This app can calculate several parameters needed for the chlorination process, including chlorine 
                dose, concentration, and residual chlorine; and provide the solution in just one click. It will be 
                highly useful for drinking water, pool and spa chlorine treatment calculations, as well as raw water
                 treatment in the water industry. More features shall be added to the app such as those needed to resolve 
                 issues associated with shock chlorination and pH fluctuations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tool employes the principle of water treatment through chlorination for its functionalities, 
                however, it is good to read the <a href="./disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a> before using it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key factor to consider while using Aquachloro calculator is that it focuses more on solid 
                chlorine compounds such aS high-test calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl)<sub>2</sub>) which exist in solid powder or pellets. 
                If your raw chlorine is in liquid form, the developer is working on a tool to handle it, which 
                shall be added to an updated version of this application.

            <h2>Features of Aquachloro Calculator</h2>
            <p>Currently, this tool has two features as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Chlorine dose calculator:
                        <p>
                            Chlorine dose calculator: This feature is used to calculate the mass of raw chlorine needed to 
                            obtain a desired concentration in water. It is mostly useful when you know the concentration in 
                            ppm or mg/L that you want to achieve. The chlorine chlorine-dose-calculator will help you to know 
                            the exact mass (g) to measure into the raw water container. Assuming you want to attain a 
                            concentration of 2ppm in raw water tank, all you need is to input the 2ppm and the volume of your 
                            container. The app will tell you how much raw chlorine you need to acquire such a concentration.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>chlorine-concentration-calculator:
                        This feaature allows you to know the exact concentration of pure chlorine in water after adding
                        a measured amount into the tank. The concentration is given in ppm which is same as mg/L.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h2>My misson</h2>
            <p>
                My misson I have worked in the food and water industry. One of the thing that bothered me was 
                that we had to do calculations here and there each time we wanted to treat water or carryout 
                quality analysis, at least in most cases. There are many tools out there to make these calculations 
                easier, only that some of them are not dependable. Also, many of such tools focus on gallon (gal), 
                cubic meter (m3), Ounce (oz), instead of litre (L), kilogram (kg) and mg/L units popular in 
                countries like Nigeria. This means that one would have to go through a lot of unnecessary 
                conversional calculations before arriving at an answer. Besides, those tools also focus on large 
                volumes of water like spa. Therefore, it has always been on my mind to bring this solution: a tool 
                that calculates, simplifies, and gives answer in the language people in my locality can understand. 
                It has to be user-friendly and simple design. That is how Aquachloro Calculator came to be.
            </p>
            <p>This tool is still under development. If you have suggestions or discover a bug, feel free
